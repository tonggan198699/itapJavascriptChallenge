# itapJavascriptChallenge
Create a single page application that consumes data from StarWarApi

#Requirements
- Allow the user to choose and search different resources (ships, planets, people etc.)
- Display the results in a table.
- For each type of resource, display the required fields specified in the JSON schema for that resource type, also available through the API.
- Implement a simple pagination using the API response (hint: "next": " https://swapi.co/api/people/?page=2 ").

#Nice to haves
- Add some CSS to prettify the application
- Anything you can think of to improve the app!
